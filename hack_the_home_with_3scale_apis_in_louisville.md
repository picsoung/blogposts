#Hack the Home with 3scale APIs in Louisville

If you read this blog often you may remember that our Evangelist, [Nicolas](http://twitter.com/picsoung) spent some time back in November in Louisville, Kentucky to [hack a fridge](http://www.3scale.net/2014/11/fridge-hacking-louisville/). He visited the [FirstBuild](http://firstbuild.com) factory when engineers are hack the alliances we all know and use everyday.

This weekend this great team of doers is hosting their first big hackathon: Hack The Home. They managed to gather 250 hackers and awesome sponsors. Hackers will have access to top of the notch devices and machines.
Imagine being able to use a CNC laser cutter to build a custom case for your Arduino project. I am not even name dropping technologies here, it's real. Hackers will really have access to all the facilities of the factory.

At 3scale, we are really excited to be supporting this first edition. We have selected 10 APIs of our portfolio of clients that we will be excited to see people hacking with:

[APIdaze](http://www.apidaze.io/) - API for WebRTC, VoIP and SMS

[Kairos](https://www.kairos.com/) - Face recognition API

[Bitcasa](https://developer.bitcasa.com/) - Store file system API, if you need to store pictures, receipts, files in general

[Wine.com](https://api.wine.com/) - API about Wine

[BetterDoctor](https://developer.betterdoctor.com/) - Doctors database

[Musixmatch](https://developer.musixmatch.com/) - Lyrics API

[WeatherUnlocked](https://developer.weatherunlocked.com/) - Weather Data API

[OpenPhacts](https://dev.openphacts.org/) - Pharmacology Dataset

[Beamly](https://develop.beamly.com/) - Data about TV programs/schedule and live

[US. Department of Energy](http://www.energy.gov/developer-resources)

[Transicat](http://www.transicast.com/) - Real time transport info in North America (bus, train, metro,...)


We are also really happy to see Nutritionix as one of the supporting sponsor of this hackathon.

Hackers will also have access to APItools proxy. Which is an incredible tool to use during hackathon as we have explained during our [Tips to Rock at Hackathon](http://www.slideshare.net/3scale/tips-torockathackathons-apitoosby3scale) presentation.

Did I mention, hackers will also be able to hack a real [DeLorean](https://www.hackster.io/delorean/projects) ?

If you are interested to join, they may still have few tickets available :)
